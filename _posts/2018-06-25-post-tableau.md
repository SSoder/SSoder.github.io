With the prevalence of Tableau as a data exploration and
visualization tool, learning to use this powerful piece of
software is a worthwhile endeavor. As you continue to read,
come along with me on my journey from displaying a few
charts and graphs to learning and better understanding the
software to display interesting and informative data
visualizations.

### The First Brush:
My first project on Tableau, this dashboard is a fairly straightforward
 visualization I created to familiarize myself with the basics of the Tableau
  software. I downloaded the Superstore Sample data set from this [Tableau community](https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236) page,
and utilized that data to create a dashboard that gives an overview of sales
with data divided variously between regional, product, and consumer group
information.

Further visualizations will be added to this post as they are created.
