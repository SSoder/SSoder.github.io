With the prevalence of Tableau as a data exploration and
visualization tool, learning to use this powerful piece of
software is a worthwhile endeavor. As you continue to read,
come along with me on my journey from displaying a few
charts and graphs to learning and better understanding the
software to display interesting and informative data
visualizations.

### The First Brush:
My first project on Tableau, I created this with no direction or tutorial, just an exploration of the program and
it's basic capabilities. I downloaded the Superstore Sample data set from this [Tableau community](https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236) page,
and after importing into tableau, put together a fairly simple dashboard, that gives an overview of sales with data divided
variously between regional, product, and consumer group information.
