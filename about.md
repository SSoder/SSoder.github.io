Hi there! My name is Stefan Soder. I am an engineer and aspiring analyst and data scientist.


I moved to the Cincinnati area after I earned my BS in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University's Indianapolis, IN campus. I have been working as a mechanical engineer for three and a half years, and have discovered a passion for data and data science that drives me to pursue the field professionally.


I hope you enjoy exploring this growing, living compilation of learning and work, and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, or if you like what you see and want to talk business, let's have a conversation!
